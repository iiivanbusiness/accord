// leaves untouched) — pulls out the shape of the conversation, not just the
// deal terms: what came up, what pushed back, who got mentioned as an
// alternative, what happens next. Runs once, right when a call finishes,
// same as extractActionItems — but takes a transcript directly rather than
// a callId, because the Recall.ai bot-call flow (src/app/api/recall/webhook/
// route.ts) never creates a Call row at all, so a callId-only signature
// would silently never fire for that flow (the same gap ActionItem has
// today). callId is passed through when the caller has one, purely to link
// the row for display — never required. Best-effort: callers wrap this in
// try/catch.
