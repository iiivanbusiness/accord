SealMe rings your phone, and when you pick up it calls the lead from your number and connects you. It works the same when you tap Call on your computer.",

        question: "What happens after I hang up?",
        answer:
          "SealMe transcribes the call and works out whether it was a cold call or a sales call. A cold call updates the lead with a summary, interest, objections and the next step. A sales call creates the client, the deal and a draft contract for you to review; nothing goes to the client on its own. If HubSpot or Salesforce is connected, the lead's status and a call summary are added there too.",

      {
        question: "Can I call before my number is verified?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is every call recorded?",
        answer:
          "No. SealMe follows the recording law of the client's US state, which it reads from the area code. Where one person's consent is enough, the call is recorded. In states that need everyone's consent (CA, CT, DE, FL, IL, MD, MA, MT, NV, NH, PA, WA), or when the state can't be told, the call isn't recorded and you call the client directly. Calls outside the US, to toll-free numbers or to leads with no number aren't recorded either.",
