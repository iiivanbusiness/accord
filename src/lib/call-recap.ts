// A short, natural-sounding spoken recap of what a call produced — read
// aloud right when the rep stops a locally-recorded call, so they hear a
// human-style confirmation instead of having to read the deal page. Reuses
// the same summary/fields the live extraction already produced; this is
// just a second, small pass that turns them into something meant to be
// heard rather than read. Deliberately terse (a hard word cap, not just an
// instruction) — the call summary itself is NOT meant to be read aloud,
// only used as context, since testing showed the model would otherwise
// just recite it end to end instead of producing a short spoken update.
// If anything is still missing, names it and asks what to put there — the
// rep can answer that directly via the push-to-talk button, which now
// accepts corrections for missing fields too (see interpretVoiceCorrection).
// Returns null when there's nothing worth reading back yet (call ended
// before anything was captured) — the caller treats that as "skip it".
